# Image Blob Detection

This project demonstrates how to detect blobs in images using the [Laplacian of Gaussian](http://fourier.eng.hmc.edu/e161/lectures/gradient/node8.html) kernel.  This forms part of the [SIFT algorithm](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/papers/ijcv04.pdf). The `main.py` file should be run first.
