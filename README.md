# Image Blob Detection

This project demonstrates how to detect blobs in images using the [Laplacian of Gaussian](http://fourier.eng.hmc.edu/e161/lectures/gradient/node8.html) kernel.  This forms part of the [SIFT algorithm](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/papers/ijcv04.pdf). By default, blobs are detected in the `images/sunflowers.jpg` image using `src/main.py`, but the `filename` variable in `src/main.py` can be adjusted to detect blobs in other images. More details can be found in `report.pdf`. Note that basic NumPy operations were used to enforce better understanding of the algorithm.
