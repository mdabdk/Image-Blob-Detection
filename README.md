# NCSU ECE 558 Project 4

This is the final project assigned in the ECE 558 course at North Carolina State University.

This project involves blob detection using part of the SIFT algorithm, as detailed [here](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/papers/ijcv04.pdf).

The **main.py** file is the top-level file that should be run first.
